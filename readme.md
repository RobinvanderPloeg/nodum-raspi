# Install

Run this command in the terminal (Control Alt F1 to go there, Control Alt F7 to go back to the GUI):

```
curl -sL iot.nodum.io/install | sudo bash -
```

Is the keyboard layout f*cked, and can't enter the 'pipe' sign (`|`)? Use:

```
wget iot.nodum.io/install
```
```
sudo bash install
```
